     <p2>There are so much difficulties comes in our life. That's the signal that you are a living being. We should never afraid of difficulties.
         Because I am a book lover and I read many books. And most of the books tells that suffering is best thing. It makes us strong, 
     as a person walk in a strom he or she never remain the same person who walk in. one become strong mentally and physically.
